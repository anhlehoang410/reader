Need to theme better for Android/set a default theme that makes
scrollbars wide enough to be touched.

Figure out why some books show no text at all.

Figure out a better way to display notifications/messages.

Make the dictionary lookup asynchronous, load dictionary in a separate
thread with progress indicator.

Figure out how to allow alteration of words in the button bar sensitive
area.

Allow un-removal of words (perhaps a swipe gesture undoes all changes
in an area?)

Support more elements/types of formatting. 

Show a book position indicator bar.

More unit tests.
