If on Ubuntu, qmake-qt4 calliope.pro ; make ; ./calliope

If on Windows, install the latest Qt SDK from 
http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk/ , open calliope.pro in Creator,
build.

If building for Android, grab the Necessitas SDK from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/necessitas/files/, open calliope.pro in
Creator, build.

The app should compile on a Mac, but I don't have one to test with.
